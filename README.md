# Flare Starter Pack

This is a mod for the Free Libre Action RPG Engine (http://flarerpg.org) that provides the basic resources needed to launch the game to a playable state.

The goal is to ease the process needed to get up and running with creating a stand-alone game on the Flare engine.

##  Setup

Just copy the flare-starter-pack directory from the mods/ directory to the mods/ directory for Flare. Then you can enable the mod in the Configuration menu. The flare-starter-pack is intended to be used by itself, so disable other mods like fantasycore and alpha_demo.

	cd ./flare-engine
	./flare

If language configuration is not English, then change language to English.
